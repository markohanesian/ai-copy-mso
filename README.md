**MarketingCopyAI** is a cutting-edge marketing copywriting tool powered by AI technology, enabling users to generate tailored marketing content based on predefined tones and industries. This application allows users to create effective and engaging copy that meets their marketing needs efficiently.

## Instructions

## About
I developed MarketingCopyAI as a user-friendly platform to assist businesses and individuals in creating impactful marketing messages effortlessly. The application is built using React for the frontend, with an Express.js API serving as the backend and utilizing PostgreSQL for data storage. It leverages Hugging Face's powerful Zephyr language model to generate copy, ensuring a smooth user experience with advanced AI capabilities.

Building MarketingCopyAI involved several key steps. Initially, I set up the React frontend and integrated the Express.js API for handling requests related to generating marketing copy and fetching presets. PostgreSQL was used for storing the available presets and generated copies, ensuring data persistence. The UI was designed to be intuitive, allowing users to quickly navigate and generate marketing content.
