# 🤖 AI Marketing Copy Generator

A full-stack application that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate high-conversion marketing blurbs based on user-defined tones and industries. This project features a **Node.js/Express** backend and a **React** frontend styled with **Material UI**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This app allows users to input a product description and receive AI-generated copy tailored to specific professional or casual tones. The backend acts as a secure proxy to the **Hugging Face Router**, ensuring API keys remain hidden from the client side.

## 🛠️ Features

* **Concurrent Execution**: Run both the server and the frontend with a single command.
* **AI-Powered Generation**: Uses the Hugging Face Router for high-speed inference.
* **Modern UI**: Built with Material UI (MUI) components, including skeletons for loading states and snackbars for notifications.
* **Stateless Backend**: Simplified Express architecture optimized for speed and reliability.
